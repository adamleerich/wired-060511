<h1>WIRED - Windows Registry Dataset</h1>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>WIRED is both a <em>Wi</em>ndows <em>Re</em>gistry <em>D</em>ataset and a set of tools for creating the dataset. The dataset contains the changes to the Windows Registry caused by application installation, de-installation, execution or other Registry modifying operations. The applications are chosen to be of interest to computer forensic examiners.</p>

<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>WIRED is currently just an experimental prototype. We are planning to solicit feedback from the computer forensics community to improve and extend its usefulness.</p>

<h2>The Dataset</h2>

<p>The dataset can be found <a href="dat/wired.zip">here</a>.</p>

<p>The WIRED dataset currently has the following fields:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>CHANGE_TYPE</em> - whether the Registry entry was added, deleted or modified</li>
<li><em>APP_NAME</em> - the application's name</li>
<li><em>NSRL_APP_ID</em> - if the application is part of the NSRL, its NSRL app ID</li>
<li><em>ACTION</em> - whether the application was installed, deinstalled, executed or some other type of registry modification occurred</li>
<li><em>ENTRY_TYPE</em> - is the Registry entry a key or value?</li>
<li><em>PATH</em> - the Registry entry's path</li>
<li><em>VALUE_NAME</em> - if the entry is a value, its name</li>
<li><em>VALUE_DATA</em> - if the entry is a value, the data it contains</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Tools</h2>

<p>There are currently two tools:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>reg-diff.rb</em> - generates a XML-based difference between two Microsoft RegEdit-generated Registry patch files.</li>
<li><em>mk-dataset.rb</em> - creates the WIRED dataset from difference files generated by <em>reg-diff.rb</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>They can be found <a href="src/wired-src.tgz">here</a>. The WIRED tools are currently implemented in Ruby (1.8.4) and were tested in Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger). They should work with other BSD-style operating systems, but we haven't tried that yet.</p>

<p>Documentation for both of these tools and associated libraries are <a href="doc/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Caveats and Future Directions</h2>

<p>WIRED is currently just an experimental prototype. We've run into the limitations of using RegEdit to generate Registry dumps and will have to better handle the problematic Registry entries. Currently, <em>reg-diff.rb</em> will issue warnings like the following for text-based entries with embedded binary data that don't translate well to RegEdit's text-based output:</p>

<p><code>Warning: Ignoring badly formatted value found in SetupRasputin.reg: [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\W32Time] "=</code></p>

<p>We've also only begun identifying, acquiring and processing software for inclusion in the dataset. Much of it is not the type of software currently found in the NSRL, but exists as shareware and freeware downloadable from the Web.</p>

<p>Finally, we envision the current prototype as only a small step in a much larger scheme that includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>An XML database for managing the Registry difference files. This will allow for the efficient query and manipulation of acquired Registry data.</li>
<li>Direct interfaces to the Registry data via Microsoft's APIs.</li>
<li>Acquistion and cryptographic hashing of all files installed or modified by an application of interest.</li>
<li>Expansion of Registry modification detection to beyond just application installation to include all phases of an application's life cycle on a given machine.</li>
<li>Investigation of installation and testing automation to improve our ability to keep up with the explosion of new software found on the Web.</li>
</ul>
